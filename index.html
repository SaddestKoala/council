            <p>This is my formal application to become the next leader of the council. I barely missed Halloween so I would carry on with the same theme because why not. Links above lead to their respective steam pages in case anyone wants to buy them.</p>

            <p>Hollow Knight an epic action adventure through a vast ruined kingdom of insects and heroes. I have had it for a long time and like every other game on this list I am just looking for an excuse to play it. I think council would be very helpful in directing me through the game and maybe adding extra challenges in the playthrough.</p>
